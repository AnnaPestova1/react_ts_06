-------------------
###### Disclaimer
###### This is a free React with TypeScript course that is intended for future (or present) front-end developers, to advance the skills. When enrolling in this course, students will be expected to know [certain things](https://github.com/RedRoverSchool/react_ts_06/blob/main/README.md#warningbare-minimum-to-succeed-in-reactts-coursewarning) beforehand. Please, do not expect from this course any basic training (i.e. How to use GitHub). A pace has been set to learn and the course has a limited time for completion. After completing the course, all students are offered to take part in the final project that could lead all the motivated participants to an employment. There are no mandatory classes or homeworks, everything just depends on the degree of your motivation and your end goals.

## About the course
React is a JS library that allows us - frontend developers - to develop efficiently. TypeScript is a JS superstructure that gives you better tooling at any scale. This course's goal is to give you the understanding of React.js library, to allow you to start building single page applications and utilise TypeScript on top of JavaScript. By the end of this course, you should be able to create basic React.js web apps, style them and test them.

## ðŸ“šSending completed homework for feedback
Every Wednesday, in the end of the main lecture, a few take-home tasks are offered to practice the lecture material. You have to be on the list of students in order to be able to receive homework feedback. Homework is done via GitHub Classroom and there is a deadline set for each week's tasks. If you missed the deadline, but have a good reason 'why', you can get the extenuating circumstances, in other instances, the homework will not be accepted after the deadline.

## Sharing code with others
Never send your code as a plain text in any direct messages. Please, use [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) - it is a free tool to share your code snippets fast and clean. Make sure to be logged in your github account to use it.

## ðŸ¤“How to do it right?
Attend the lectures and complete your homework on time. Besides lectures, you are expected to spend time reading official documentations, googling, learn to ask proper questions, and sourcing helpful information on your own. 50% of success is in your dedication to the course material. The other 50% come from practice. This means, you should go along with course to get a timely feedback in order to really learn. It is not recommended to skip parts with false hopes to learn it 'later'. You can only get a working knowledge of React/TS, if you follow the rules of our community and are genuinely invested in the process.
